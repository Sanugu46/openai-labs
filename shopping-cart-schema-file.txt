A customer can have multiple cart items (many-to-many relationship between "Customers" and "Cart Items" managed through the "cart_item_id" foreign key in "Cart Items").
Each cart item is linked to a specific product (foreign key "product_id" in "Cart Items").
An order belongs to a single customer (foreign key "customer_id" in "Orders").
